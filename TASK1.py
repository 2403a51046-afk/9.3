def sum_even_odd_from_input():
    """
    Prompts the user to enter a sequence of integers separated by spaces.
    Calculates and prints the sum of even and odd numbers separately.
    If the input contains non-integer values, an error message is displayed.

    Steps:
        1. User enters numbers separated by spaces (e.g., "1 2 3 4 5").
        2. The input is split and converted to integers.
        3. The sum of even and odd numbers is calculated and printed.
        4. If any input is not an integer, an error message is shown.
    Returns:
        None
